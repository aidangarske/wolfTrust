/* Vault storage-face security negatives (WT-FFM-0044 / WT-FFM-0048). Keys no
 * longer live in the vault — they are held by the wolfHSM server keystore
 * reached through the SERVICE_HSM relay, and their cross-client isolation is
 * proven in tests/host/keystore_isolation. What remains here is the vault's
 * own storage face: every object is namespaced by the SPM-stamped caller
 * identity (the `owner` argument), which no partition can forge on target, so
 * these host calls with distinct owners model distinct partitions:
 *
 *   N1  a different sub_owner in the same owner is disjoint                0044
 *   N2  a forged sub_owner never crosses to another owner                 0044
 *   N3  a sealed object is invisible cross-owner and rolls back to auth   0048
 *   N4  the internal KEY / SEALED label flags cannot be forged from a
 *       storage SET, nor can an unknown flag bit be passed                0046/0048

# Phase validation ledger

This ledger records validation against the exact wolfTrust phase commit. A
M33MU result is emulator evidence for the Cortex-M33 execution model; it is
not a physical-board result. Hardware qualification remains open until a
target is available.

## Phase 3 local acceptance

Commit: `2bc5f70e69faedfeadca5d45f317ff6a880df6ef`

- Aggregate host validation: `make test BUILD_ROOT=/tmp/wolftrust-phase3-capability-tests`, passed.
- Focused production policy validation: `make -C tests/host/spm BUILD_DIR=/tmp/wolftrust-phase3-spm-capabilities run`, passed.
- Complete local M33MU lifecycle: passed with wolfBoot authentication,
  wolfTrust startup, wolfCOSE Initial Attestation signing and verification,
  Zephyr PSA operations, and FreeRTOS wolfHSM-backed wolfPKCS11 operations.
- Expected terminal marker: `[EXPECT BKPT] Success`.
- Fault markers: none.

- Zephyr guest: `60a7c51c08d5503885eb26170eef483fdace52e8c85254d18b65d5e423485daa`

This is emulator evidence. No physical STM32H563 result is claimed for this
commit.

## Current no-hardware gate

Commit: `36d28a5264c145e8aa71dab447db8d397152499c`

- Host validation: [workflow run 31059194072](https://github.com/aidangarske/wolfTrust/actions/runs/31059194072) — passed.
- M33MU lifecycle matrix: [workflow run 31059193766](https://github.com/aidangarske/wolfTrust/actions/runs/31059193766) — passed.
  - wolfBoot authenticated the secure wolfTrust image.
  - Zephyr exercised PSA Initial Attestation, rejected the short buffer,
    received a token, and verified the wolfCOSE COSE_Sign1 signature, challenge,
    identity, lifecycle, and measurement claims.
  - FreeRTOS exercised wolfHSM-backed wolfPKCS11 initialization, slot and
    session setup, and SHA-256 digest.
  - Both lifecycle jobs reached `[EXPECT BKPT] Success` and exited M33MU with
    status 0; no fault marker was emitted.

Physical STM32H563 H5 validation is pending. The board was not available for
the corrected-image run, so no H5 hardware pass or failure is claimed here.

## Phase gate rule

Every implementation phase must repeat host tests and the complete M33MU
matrix on its exact phase commit. When target hardware is available, the same
phase must additionally record a physical-board smoke result covering the
phase behavior.

# Arm PSA FF conformance adapter

This adapter compiles selected upstream Arm PSA Firmware Framework tests
without modifying their source. The exact repository revision is stored in
`tests/upstream/psa-arch-tests.rev`.

Run the current conformance gate from the repository root:

```sh
make test-conformance
```

The current host gate executes upstream tests `i001`, `i003` through `i008`,
`i010`, `i011`, `i012`, `i024`, `i025`, `i026`, `i067`, `i071`, `i088`, and
`i090`. These cover framework and service versions, the invec/outvec data
plane (`psa_read`/`psa_skip`/`psa_write`/`psa_set_rhandle`), invalid service
IDs, strict, relaxed, and unspecified version policies, Secure-only access
policy, a successful Secure connection lifecycle, closing and calling with an
invalid or null handle, calling with more than `PSA_MAX_IOVEC` vectors, calling
with a negative message type, memory manipulation, and RoT lifecycle state.
`i067` reports SKIP: it requires SP heap allocation support, which wolfTrust
does not advertise.

`i003` and `i027` need a real server, not the generic reply-success dispatch,
so `main.c` carries a per-test dispatch: a `g_active_test` selector routes
`test_dispatch()` to the matching per-test server. `dispatch_i003()` replicates
the upstream server's byte-level `psa_read`/`psa_skip` sequence (partial reads,
outbound read returns the remaining bytes then zero), write concatenation, and
`psa_set_rhandle` persistence across calls. `i027` replies `PROGRAMMER_ERROR`
to the call to drop the connection; that also required a wolfTrust fix so a
client may `psa_close` a dropped (`WT_IPC_CONNECTION_ERROR`) connection, not
only an idle one. The harness `val` vtable gained `ipc_connect`/`ipc_close`.

The unspecified-version-policy tests (`i010`, `i011`, `i026`) model an
`UNSPECIFIED` manifest service the way FF-M resolves its defaults: version 1 and
`STRICT` policy. `i026` and `i090` also required wolfTrust conformance fixes to
`psa_call`, both in the PROGRAMMER-ERROR family: `in_len + out_len >
PSA_MAX_IOVEC` and a negative message type now return
`PSA_ERROR_PROGRAMMER_ERROR` per FF-M, not `PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

Every other `ff/ipc` test in the pinned suite was evaluated and is currently
blocked on one of: server-side per-service dispatch not yet added to the
`g_active_test` router (`i002` connection lifecycle, `i063` signal-mask
filtering — each host-viable), real multi-partition memory
isolation (`i048`-`i053`, which need the SPM to reject a caller vector pointing
into another partition's MMIO — M33MU only), or a client that itself runs as a
Secure Partition (`i058` doorbell, compiled out under `-DNONSECURE_TEST_BUILD`).
See task-list.md Phase 3 item 10.

This focused host gate is not the complete Arm architecture suite. The full
suite requires its Non-secure application and three Secure test partitions to
run through wolfTrust's production Armv8-M SPM and isolation path. Phase 3 is
not conformant until those binaries execute under M33MU and every applicable
test result is recorded.

wolfTrust's independent implementation tests live in `tests/host/ffm`. They
cover properties outside the selected upstream cases, including forged and
stale handles, caller ownership, bounded pools, message scrubbing, vector
limits, and output-pointer revalidation.

"""Stamp pinned guest measurements into wolftrust.bin before signing.

Usage:
  patch_guest_digests.py <wolftrust.bin> <guest_id>:<version>:<guest.bin> ...

Locates the guest-measurement slot by magic (see port/stm32h563/partitions.c
wt_guest_meas_slot_t), writes one record per argument (guest_id, version,
image_size, SHA-256), and rewrites the image in place. Must run BEFORE the
wolfBoot signing step so the pins are covered by the image signature.
